# Number-Generator
This Is my first code on GitHub, I hope it's useful.
This code will only generate randon numbers every 5 seconds with a countdown.
Here Is a better description: This code sets up a timer to fire every 5 seconds, and when the timer fires, it generates and displays a random number. Meanwhile, the program also displays a countdown that decrements every second until it reaches 0. Once the countdown is complete, the program stops running.
